\chapter{Logical Methods of Reasoning}\label{chapter:logicalmethodsofreasoning}

\paragraph{}In this chapter we shall discuss the different methods of reasoning as depicted and defined by our contemporaries, we shall try to understand them and see of which we understand intuitively and which we do not.

\section{Deductive Reasoning}

\paragraph{}The most commonplace of reasoning; next to inductive reasoning, that can be found, from my observation and experience, is deductive reasoning, this type of reasoning appears in almost every conversation, debate, or discussion. It is so familiar that a child appears to exhibit this cognitive ability naturally, as so when one were to place their hand on a candle and feel pain from the burning sensation, they would naturally keep a distance as aware that the candle caused the pain.

\paragraph{}In such, deductive reasoning from the above example, from the perspective of the child, can be broken down:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
    \item I placed my hand above the lit candle
    \item I felt a burning sensation or pain
    \item Therefore, placing my hand on a lit candle will cause me pain
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{}And thus, following this form of reasoning a child does not place their hand atop a lit candle, the underlying biological and physical mechanism may be unknown, but the reasoning followed through a deductive process, brings about a logical understanding. Some children even showing the astute ability to extend this deductive reasoning, understanding the pain was caused by the flame, and thus assumes any source of fire or extreme heat will also cause the same pain.

\paragraph{}More formally written, the logical reasoning draws a syllogistic conclusion through deduction such that (as described by Aristotle):

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
    \item All men are mortal
    \item Socrates is a man
    \item Therefore, Socrates is mortal

\end{enumerate}
